## Notes for Library

- type in isometric art gifs, you will see some japanese looking art & some 3d models as gifs. 

Collect THAT shit, and make a library! Notion is frozen with the browser so I cannot add this note in there. Having this as a backup is not that bad tbh.

- Ultimately, use these for my image practice tomorrow & thursday. 
- Also, Look back into the history and find the Vector Isometric site, and start a membership with them. Get those assets and make the library. Practice with these as well
- Finally learn how to make the vectors and combine them as needed in inkscape and make my own png file. That way I can learn how to make my own with the assets that I have.

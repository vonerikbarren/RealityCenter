# Merging the Efficiencies together.

- Here we need to let go of of the ailments, fears, and wounds, and shadows, and keep us from progressing. At some point you need to decide who you are going to be. Are you going to be faithful, efficient, honest, joyful, wonderful, merciful, inspirational, beautiful, insightful, persistent in truth, and to create a light so strong it will help this poor world? Or a chaotic figure of darkness that lies, cheats, deceives, wants but never gets because he is spoiled, and untrustworthy, undependable, and not really a person of substance only because he does not want to give more than what he has due to some misplace of pride. You know that you were NOT efficient universally. Which means infinitely there are ways known and unknown that I was inefficient in that got me where I am now. You can change that. However you need to let go Completely. The Tests are done. You know what you need to do and that’s let go. You are like Korra now, and still have pieces of that liquid metal inside of you. When you let that go… You will be the Avatar, Sora, Link, Polyglot, Philosopher, Philosopher of the Infinite. However you will not get there unless you focus on one thing. THAT. THING. IS. CODE. That is the bridge that carries us over into the land of the infinite. We arent there. We know what’s over there. But we have to build that bridge to get there. That bridge will be made out of all of the languages this world has to offer. So let go. Be aware of all of your awarenesses all at the same time. Trust the efficiency protocols, keep searching for truth. But Focus on one goal at a time to ensure we get there.

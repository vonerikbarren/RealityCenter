# Pseudocode Cheat Sheet


# How to pseudocode

1. __Identify The Problem__
  - What exactly are we trying to solve?
  - What are we delivering?
2. __Conceptualize__
  - Look at the big picture
  - Avoid details
  - Whitebaors and pen-and-paper can be useful tools here
3. __Break It Down__
  - Break the conceptual models down into concrete steps / actionable items
  - Identify risks (e.g., gaps in knowledge and technology)
4. __Start Small, stay small__
  - Write code using those concrete steps
    - Very that each step achieves what we want before continuing on
    - If we do too much at once and things break, which they always do, we wont know what is causing the problem
    - Humans thrive on easy wins and forward progreses. Use this to your advantage.
5. __Examples__

So here is our free thought space. 
Here we can write anything we want in correlation to our program. 


# Update

So as we are free writing, the state of things currently are kind of messy but I am not letting that get in the way of my dreams. Instead its actually fuel. I have procured a job and I am currently ready to tackle anything.


1st - I accept I do not have a workable application now. But just several small projects that eventually will be combined into one.

2nd - This is a pro and a con as import and export modules are the most efficient in getting this accomplished efficiently in code. 

3rd - I have tons of designs and songs to implement and ideas for tools but either they are still stuck in my head or there is no real benefit to them currently in this state. 

4th - Social media awareness is also another thing. Hence, We need to have a showcase that works on all mobile devices that is also integrated into a system that can also work for desktop. 



# Next Steps

1. Resume
2. Virtual Resume
3. Portfolio
4. Showcase (expressionÎ” + dimensional lyrics)
5. Design of Application
6. Fixing of professional profiles
7. Video editing work and integration to application (efficient process)
   - This is due to the fact that the android software is NOT compatible with Mac. 
   - So we are going to try to add our Android micro SD card to a normal one and see if it can be an efficient process. This is for all cameras as it is a single system worth noting that works. 
  
   - Once we have a solid system. Then we need daily work to the application as well use the mobile editing tools as well if needed. 
8. Sound Design.
   - We need a library of sounds of all types. Going to a sound library for categories would be in our best interest.

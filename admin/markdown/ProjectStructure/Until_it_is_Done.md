# until it is done.

Okay, we are currently in a building phase. 


We are currrently building the TimeΔ

I need to also build before prototype Luanch:

false = TimeΔ = OmniTime
false = PerspectiveΔ = OmniSight
false = ComplexityΔ = OmniComplexity
false = SpaceΔ = OmniSpace
false = ContainmentΔ = OmniContainment
false = ExpressionΔ = OmniExpress
false = FunctionΔ = OmniAction
false = ExperienncesΔ = OmniEXP
false = SystemΔ = OmniSys


Additionally, I will need to create functions instead of hard coding things so my plans can run more smoothly.

I say create an example, and write the function at the same time, that way the minimization of errors will occur. Its less time costly though. I think after a while of making a couple they can stack at will. 


// Summons

summon_Object(object, location, additionalSettings...)
summon_Objects(objectArr, locationMapperCoordinates, additionalSettings...)
